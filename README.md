# IBM Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition based on the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset. It applies data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and classification models to identify key factors influencing employee turnover.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Feature importance analysis

## Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the notebook to train and evaluate models:
